                    <li>
                        disclosed to (or otherwise acquired by) Receiving Party in a manner in which the Disclosing Party reasonably communicated, or the Receiving Party should reasonably

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Except as provided below or with the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will not:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party other than on a need-to-know basis to its directors, officers, members, managers, employees, 
                                affiliates, attorneys, and contractors, solely to the extent and only for the purpose of performing or exercising the Receiving Party’s rights and obligations 
                                under this Agreement;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, use Confidential Information other than for fulfilling the obligations or exercising the rights of the Receiving 
                                Party under this Agreement;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                allow others to make copies of such Confidential Information except as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the Receiving Party’s obligations or exercise its rights 
                                under this Agreement; or
                            </li>

                                remove or export any such Confidential Information in violation of any applicable law. The Receiving Party shall treat the Confidential Information of the Disclosing 
                                Party, and will cause its directors, employees, attorneys, affiliates, and contractors to treat such Confidential Information, with at least the same degree of care 
                                and protection as it would use with respect to its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        previously known to the Receiving Party without obligation of confidence;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        independently developed by or for the Receiving Party without use of or access to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and without breaching this Agreement;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        acquired by the Receiving Party from a third party which is not under an obligation of confidence with respect to such information; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        which is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                A Receiving Party may make a disclosure of Confidential Information if required either by applicable law or legal process (as a result of legal compulsion or in order to advance a defense 
                to a claim), in response to a request by a governmental authority or in connection with a proceeding before a court, adversary proceeding, administrative proceeding, governmental or regulatory 
                proceeding if:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        the Receiving Party only discloses that portion of the Confidential Information reasonably required to be disclosed; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        unless prohibited by law, the Receiving Party provides reasonable notice to the Disclosing Party in advance of the disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek confidential treatment 
                        for the Confidential Information, a protective order or other appropriate remedy, relief or reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded the information so disclosed 
                        at the sole cost and expense of the Disclosing Party or consent in writing to having the Confidential Information so produced or so disclosed (which consent will extend solely to the 
                        disclosure and production in question).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <u>Return and Remedies</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon the request of the Disclosing Party, or upon termination of this Agreement, Receiving Party will promptly return (or, with written permission from the Disclosing Party, destroy) all copies of 
                any Confidential Information in its possession or control and, upon request, will acknowledge to the Disclosing Party in writing that such delivery or destruction has been fully effected. The Receiving 
                Party acknowledges that the unauthorized disclosure or use of such Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm and significant injury, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, 
                the Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party will have the right to obtain an immediate injunction enjoining any breach of the Disclosing Party’s confidentiality obligations, as well as the right 
                to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a breach.
            </p>
            <h3>Indemnification</h3>
            <p>Subscriber will defend (at Sales Agency AI’s option), indemnify, and hold Sales Agency AI and its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, assignees, owners, directors, officers, employees, contractors, representatives, 
                and agents (collectively, “Sales Agency AI Indemnitees”) harmless from and against any and all claims, governmental investigations, demands, actions, and proceedings, real or threatened, and all losses, judgments, 
                awards, settlements, damages, fines, injuries, penalties, and costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising out of or related to:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including the representations and warranties contained herein, by Subscriber,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subscriber’s negligence or misconduct, or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subscriber’s use of the Services or information obtained therefrom (including without limitation Subscriber transmitting or receiving communications through the Service).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                If Sales Agency AI elects for Subscriber to provide defense, Subscriber will:
                <ol>
                    <li>

            <h3>Relationship of the Parties</h3>
            <p>
                The parties hereto are independent contractors. Neither party is an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of the other. Neither party shall have the right to bind the other to any agreement with a third party or to incur any obligation or 
                liability on behalf of the other party.
            </p>
            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
                Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement or any breach, termination, or validity thereof (a “Dispute”) shall be solely and exclusively resolved by arbitration. The demand for arbitration 
                shall be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. 
                The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to American Arbitration Association rules and procedures for commercial arbitration, including provisions for the resolution of consumer disputes, if applicable (the “Arbitration Rules”). 
                The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Either party may bring a Dispute in small claims court in New York, New York to the extent permitted by 
                the Arbitration Rules. If the amount in controversy is less than $10,000, the parties agree that the Dispute will be decided on the basis of written submissions without a hearing. The decision of the arbitrator will be final without an option to 
                appeal. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive, special, consequential, or indirect damages against any party. Arbitration costs and fees shall be divided in accordance with the Arbitration 
                Rules. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so 
                determines. No disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND USING THE SERVICES, 
                EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE; AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PRESENT ITS CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN A 
                COURT OF LAW OR BEFORE A JURY. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s), if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
            </p>
            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
                This Agreement is governed according to the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of law principles. Subject to the dispute resolution process described above, all claims, disputes, and suits must be brought exclusively in the 
                state or federal courts located in New York, New York, and the parties agree to the jurisdiction thereof.
            </p>
            <h3>Export Laws and International Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                Subscriber agrees to fully comply with all U.S. and other applicable export laws and regulations. Subscriber is not permitted to use the Services in connection with the processing of personal data of an EU, EEA, UK, or Swiss data subject or of any person 
                located outside the United States of America.
            </p>
            <h3>Severability and Survivability</h3>
            <p>
                If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement to be contrary to law or public policy or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect; and the invalid provision shall remain in force as 
                reformed by the court. Portions of this Agreement which by their nature would survive termination thereof (e.g., disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, indemnification) shall be deemed to survive.
            </p>
            <h3>Waiver</h3>
            <p>
                No term or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, and no breach consented to or excused unless such waiver, consent, or excuse is in writing and signed by the party claiming to have waived, consented, or excused. Should either party consent, waive, 
                or excuse a breach by the other party, such shall not constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse of any other different or subsequent breach whether or not of the same kind as the original breach.        
            </p>
            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>
                Each party represents and warrants to the other party that such party has the legal power to enter into this Agreement, that the signatory hereto has the authority to bind the applicable party, and this Agreement will constitute a legal, valid, and binding obligation 
                of each party in accordance with its terms. Except for the payment of fees by Subscriber, if either party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out its obligations hereunder due to a force majeure event (i.e., act of God, strike, industrial disturbance, fire, 
                storm, flood, epidemic/pandemic, utility failure, governmental restraint, war, or another similar event), such party’s obligations under this Agreement will be suspended during the force majeure event. Subscriber agrees that ambiguities in this Agreement will not be 
                construed against Sales Agency AI by attribution of drafting. Sales Agency AI may assign any of its rights or obligations to others at any time without notice to Subscriber. Subscriber may not assign any of its rights or obligations to others without Sales Agency AI’s 
                prior written consent.
