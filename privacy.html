            </p>
            <p>
                Sales Agency AI (“Sales Agency AI”, “we,” “us,” “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, disclose, and 
                protect your Personal Information (defined below) and how to exercise any rights you might have with respect to this information. This Privacy Policy governs information 
                we collect through our website and mobile website (collectively, “Site”) and information we collect from you or third parties through any other means to provide our 
                services or perform other business activities (collectively, “Services”).
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected by Sales Agency AI through the Site and Services and does not apply to our privacy practices with regard to data we 
                process on behalf of companies for whom we perform work (“Clients”). For information about the collection, use, and disclosure of your information by our Clients or by 
                us on behalf of our Clients, please review the relevant Client’s privacy policy.
            </p>

                        CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
                        <br>
                        We occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our products and services and customer feedback, or if required by applicable US law. When we 
                        post changes, we revise the “last updated” date at the top of this statement. Your use of the Site is subject to the then effective Privacy Policy.

                        CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS POLICY AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS
                        <br>
                        When local laws and regulations require a higher level of protection for your Personal Information, they take precedence over this Privacy Policy. In addition, 
                        the specific requirements of this Privacy Policy apply only when local laws and regulations permit.
